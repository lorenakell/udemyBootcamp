    <h1>Chicken</h1>

    <p>
      The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the
      red junglefowl, with attributes of wild species such as grey and ceylon
      junglefowl that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is
      a term for an adult male bir gd, and a younger male may be called a
      cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird
      is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.

      Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens
      were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries
      BC). Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming
      both their meat and eggs) and as pets.

      Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with
      a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, up from more than 19
      billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.
      There are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and
      religion, and in language and literature.

      Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia,
      Southeast Asia, and East Asia, but the clade found in the Americas,
      Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian
      subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western
      Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC. Fowl have been known in
      Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every
      day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia,
      according to the annals of Thutmose III.
